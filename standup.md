What did I work on yesterday?
Yesterday, I worked on the team formation. We chatted and got to know with each others. Besides, I worked on the lab3.

What am I working on today?
I will spend most of my time working on Lab3. I have a Math quiz on Friday.

What issues are blocking me?
Sometimes, I do not understand the description of the lab, so I am stuck easily on the Lab. Luckily, there are many tutors available today, so my problems can be solved easily.
